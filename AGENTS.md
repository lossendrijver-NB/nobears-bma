## Architecture
- Content lives in src/content/data.ts and is only read through src/content/repository.ts — so a CMS/database can replace storage without UI changes.
- Ambition.serviceIds and Case.serviceIds are the single source of relations; reverse links are derived in the repository — avoids duplicated, drifting links.
- Search is pure, local and deterministic in src/lib/search.ts (no AI/external APIs in V1) — reproducible results, UI-independent.
- Service pages take an optional `from` ambition slug search param to drive the back button — survives refresh and direct URLs.
